# TypeaheadDropdown

A very simple typeahead dropdown with search written in Angular.

## Run

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Notes

The main `TypeaheadDropdownComponent` accepts an action that will fetch items from some source (db, endpoint, etc.). In this version, the item source is hardcoded locally for demonstration purposes.
